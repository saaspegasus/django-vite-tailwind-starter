Django Vite Tailwind Starter Project
====================================

This is a starter / demo project, built on top of `django-admin startproject`.
It adds a [Vite](https://vite.dev/) front end pipeline configured to include
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/).

This project is the companion piece to [this guide to integrating Django and Vite](#todo).
